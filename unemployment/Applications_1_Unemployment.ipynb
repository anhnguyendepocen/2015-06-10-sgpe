Note that before the agent calculates the best policy instantaneously - actually, ALL the agents calcualte the best response at the begining of the period. The last **cool exercise** above dealt precisely with this assumption and what it did involve for unemployment dynamics.\n",

    "In this world the agen't does not know the distribution of wages, and learns about it by sampling wage offers. For exmaple, if the agent has received a series of offers of $[3.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.0]$, then she thinks that the distribution is $E(p)_{t=4}=[0.25,0.75,0.0]$. But if she then gets a wage offer of 5.0, then she *updates her beliefs* to $E(p)_{t=5}=[0.2, 0.6, 0.2]$.\n",

In \"Bad Times\" you have more chances of getting a low wage offer that in \"Good Times\". She updates her beliefs about the right distribution using  the *Bayes Rule*, which is a weighted average of how likely the wage sequence $w_t$ is under each of the possible distributions. More formally, call $\\pi_t$ the probability that we are in $f$ (bad times) and $w_t$ the sequence of wages obtained at time $t$:\n",

    "You already know the mechanics behind the VFI: give a guess to $\\hat{V}$, iterate (calculate the new $V_s$ and $V_u$, compare them, and choose the highest ones to be our new $\\hat{V}$) until convergence. The fact that the equations can be encapsulated into a Bellman equation ensures convergence. Here the mecahnichs are similar, but notice that now we have a *continous* distribution, so we have potentially **infinite** $V_s$. This only complicates the math a little, but don't worry, the code will do it for us!\n",

    "Also before we didn't calculate the ***reservation wage*** (the wage for which we should reject all offers below it and accept above), because getting the choice vector was realatively easy - our wage distribution had only three points. Now the choice vector can have **a lot more** wages, so it makes sense to us to reformulate the Choice vector $C$ as $\\bar{w}(C)$ being $\\bar{w}$ our reservation wage.\n",

    "Let's take a look to *odu.py*, shcih contains the `SearchProblem` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__init__(params)` This function creates and stores the model class. It has some default parameters on it, but if you want to change them, their order is $\\beta=0.95$, $c=0.6$, $F_a=1$, $F_b=1$, $G_a=3$, $G_b=1.2$,$w_{max}=2$, $GridSize_w=40$, $GridSize_\\pi=40$. \n",
    "    - The $GridSize$ parameters contains the number of possible wages (and their probabilities).\n",
    "    - $(F_a,F_b)$ and $(G_a,G_b)$ are the parameters of the distributions $F$ and $G$. They are assumed to be [beta distributions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "*  `__repr__` and  ` __str__`: These are not necessarity needed for the code to run, but it makes it nicer. They ensure that you call `print` ont eh instance, it will let you know what's inside it - instead of just saying \"instance of SearchProblem\", it will tell you the parameters the model contains.\n",
    "       \n",
    "* `q(w, pi)`: This function updates the probabily vector using bayes rule and the new wage (see equation in 4.1).\n",
    "     \n",
    "* `bellman_operator(v)`: This function is very similar to `iterateValueFunction` above, and does exactly the same thing - but in out continous space context. Don't get lost on the notation here - this function uses much fancier functions in the QantEcon library instead of doing everything from scratch like `iterateValueFunction`. If you are wondering what `fixed_quad` is, it is a handy function for calculating integrals. You may add it to the list of \"Top Ten python functions\" you should be writing. It returns the **next step** **Value functions**, $V_s^{t+1}$ for each $w_s$.\n",
    " \n",
    "* `get_greedy(self, v)`: Same thing, but this time it calculates and returns the next step **choice vector** $C^{t+1}$ - remember, 1 is accept, 0 reject. It takes a value function as argument.\n",
    "   \n",
    "* `res_wage_operator(phi)`: Given an inital guess of a reservation wage $\\bar{w}^t$ (which is a **scalar**!) returns the next step $\\bar{w}^{t+1}$ \n",
